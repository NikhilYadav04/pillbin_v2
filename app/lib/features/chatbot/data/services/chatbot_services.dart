Guidelines: - If the question is very simple (e.g., factual, yes/no, small definition), give a **SMALL** answer (1–2 sentences). - If the question needs some explanation but not deep detail, give a **MEDIUM** answer (one short paragraph). - If the question is broad or complex, give a **LARGE** answer (multiple paragraphs with details and examples). Now provide your response using the length you judge appropriate. Question: ${text} Answer:";
